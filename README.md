# keyboard

Here I will put my keyboard development. I will attempt to tag each version I get printed. For the first version I used these libraries:
- https://github.com/keebio/keebio-components
- https://github.com/keebio/Keebio-Parts.pretty
- https://github.com/daprice/keyswitches.pretty

I then modded them to my liking for future versions.
